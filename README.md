Simple puzzle 2D Platformer  

The 2D platformer works like most other platformers and the controls reflect that . there are no enemies in the game thus thhe only controls were movement and jumping. "A" and "D"buttons for movement left and right "SPACE"for jumping

The wincondition of the game is simply to find and get all four coins. once you find and pickup a coin it will show on your screen's top right hand corner On collecting the last (4th) coin , a text will come onto the screen saying that you have won the level. The player will die and have to restart if they fall below the bottom most platforms.

Also as a note , the final coin is a bit more difficult to find and will require a leap of faith to find.I thought this was a good idea as each of the coins are in more difficult places and require more effort to get top them.
